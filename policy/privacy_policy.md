11. We use information about you to:

    Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;

    When you submit a post or comment to the Services, visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see the content of your posts and comments, the username associated with your posts or comments, and the date and time you originally submitted the post or comment. Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services.

    When other users view your profile, they will be able to see information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, Steem Power, and how long you have been a member of the Services.

13. Please note that, even when you delete your account, the posts, comments and messages you submit through the Services may still be viewable or available on our servers. For more information, see “Your Choices” below.

14. We will not share, sell, or give away any of our users’ personal information to third parties, unless one of the following circumstances applies:

    Except as it relates to advertisers and our ad partners, we may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us;

    If you participate in contests, sweepstakes, promotions, special offers, or other events or activities in connection with our Services, we may share information with entities that partner with us to provide these offerings;

    We may share information (and will attempt to provide you with prior notice, to the extent legally permissible) in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request;

    We may share information in response to an emergency if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person;

    We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements, or other steemgg policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others;

    We may share information between and among steemgg, and its current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership; and

    We may share information with your consent or at your direction.

15. We may share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

## Ads and Analytics Partners

16. We may partner with third-party advertisers, ad networks, and analytics providers to deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and to better understand your use of the Services. These third parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device. For example:

## Advertisers and Ad Networks

17. Our ad partners and network may use cookies and use related technologies to collect information when ads are delivered to you on our Services, but steemgg does not link to or provide your actual steemgg account details to these advertising partners. This means that steemgg does not share your individual account browsing habits with advertisers. Steemgg cannot see advertisers’ cookies and advertisers will not see steemgg cookies.

## Analytics Partners

18. We use analytics partners (such as Google Analytics) to help analyze usage and traffic for our Services. As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyze and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique visitors to our Services.

## Security

20. We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

21. Although we welcome users from all walks of life, steemgg is not intended or directed at individuals under the age of 18. Therefore, individuals under the age of 18 may not create an account or otherwise access or use the Services.

## Your Choices

22. As a steemgg user, you have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and disclosure of, information about you. This includes:

## Preferences

23. We may provide you with tools and preference settings that allow you to access, correct, delete, and modify information associated with your account.

## Account Information

Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others, unless you delete such content. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account. Any information that has been published to the Steem blockchain will also remain indefinitely.

## Cookies

25. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. For more information about cookies read our cookie policy section <https://steemgg.com/#/cookiePolicy> 

## Third-Party Advertising and Analytics

26. Some analytics providers may provide specific opt-out mechanisms (e.g. Google Analytics Opt-out), and we will provide, as needed, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt-out. You have the ability to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes.

## Do Not Track

27. Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in most web browsers. We support DNT in our Services. There is no accepted standard on how to respond to web browsers’ DNT signals. When you have DNT enabled, we may still use information collected for analytics and measurement purposes or to otherwise provide our Services (e.g., [steemgg.com](https://steemgg.com) buttons), but we will not load any third-party trackers. You may, however, opt out of having information about you collected and used for behavioral advertising purposes, as described above.
